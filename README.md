## Setup Instructions (for Instructors)

### Spec Harness Instructions

In order to run the spec harness, first create a directory with a `students.txt` file.

In `students.txt`, put a list of your students Github handles.  For example:

```
aziobrow
dionew1
memcmahon
s-espinosa
```

From the command line, run the following script, replacing `<repository_name` with the name of the challenge repo:

```
for i in `cat students.txt`; do
  git clone git@github.com:$i/<repository_name> $i
  cd $i
  git pull origin spec # this will cause a merge commit message
  rspec
  echo
  echo
  read -p 'Press Enter to continue'
  cd ..
done
```

For each student, you will need to create or `:q` out of a merge commit message!

## Instructions

* Fork this Repository
* Clone your forked repo
* Complete the activity Below
* Push your solution to your repo
* Submit a Pull Request from your repo to this repo
    * Put your name in your PR!

## Iteration 1

For iteration 1, we have created all of the tests you will need - unskip tests one by one, making each pass before moving on to the next test.  The tests will model the following interaction pattern:

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/school'
#=> true

pry(main)> school = School.new('9:00', 7)
#=> #<School:0x007fcaf4957830 @hours_in_school_day=7, @start_time="9:00", @student_names=[]>

pry(main)> school.start_time
#=> "9:00"

pry(main)> school.hours_in_school_day
#=> 7

pry(main)> school.student_names
#=> []
```

## Iteration 2

For iteration 2, we have created all of the tests you will need - unskip tests one by one, making each pass before moving on the the next test.  The tests will model the interaction pattern below.  The `end_time` method should add the `hours_in_school_day` to the `start_time` and return the time in 24 hour format.  For example, 3:00 PM (12hour / clock time) is 15:00 (24hour). A school day will only ever start at the top of the hour (:00).

```ruby  
pry(main)> require './lib/school'
#=> true

pry(main)> school = School.new('9:00', 7)
#=> #<School:0x007fcaf4957830 @hours_in_school_day=7, @start_time="9:00", @student_names=[]>

pry(main)> school.add_student_name('Aurora')
pry(main)> school.add_student_name('tim')
pry(main)> school.add_student_name('megan')

pry(main)> school.student_names
#=> ["Aurora", "tim", "megan"]

pry(main)> school.end_time
#=> "16:00"
```

## Iteration 3

Now, it is time for you to write your own tests!  Follow the interaction pattern below to write one test, make that test pass, and move on to the next test.  You will have at minimum, one test per new method. A school is considered full time, if its has more than 4 hours in its school day.  The method `standard_student_names` will return a list of student names, capitalized ('megan' should become 'Megan').

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/school'
#=> true

pry(main)> school = School.new('9:00', 7)
#=> #<School:0x007fcaf4957830 @hours_in_school_day=7, @start_time="9:00", @student_names=[]>

pry(main)> school.is_full_time?
#=> true

pry(main)> school.add_student_name('Aurora')
pry(main)> school.add_student_name('tim')
pry(main)> school.add_student_name('megan')

pry(main)> school.standard_student_names
#=> ["Aurora", "Tim", "Megan"]
```

## Iteration 4

Continue writing tests to satisfy the following interaction pattern. The method `convert_end_time_to_clock_time` will change the format of the end time to a 12 hour format (for example, 15:00 would be converted to 3:00).

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/school'
#=> true

pry(main)> school = School.new('9:00', 7)
#=> #<School:0x007fcaf4957830 @hours_in_school_day=7, @start_time="9:00", @student_names=[]>

pry(main)> school.convert_end_time_to_clock_time
#=> 4:00
```
